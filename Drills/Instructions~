JUnit and Drills

1. Look at problem statement and solve the given problem on paper.
2. Create a new class for the problem
3. Copy the problem statement (comment that out) and the method definition into your new class
4. Implement the solution
5. Create a Test Class for your new code
6. Implement the test code using the given test cases
7. Modify your problem solution until all test cases pass


Key Concepts for Calling Code from JUnit

1. Create the Test Class from the NetBeans menu.
2. Make sure you specify the package for your Test Class (it should be in the same package as the
class you are testing).
3. Use the built in JUnit ‘assert’ methods to evaluate your test results
a. assertTrue(...)
b. assertFalse(...)
c. assertEquals(...)
d. assertNull(...)

=============================================

Create package by logic name (drills)
create class file and solve per 1-7 above
right click package, New - JUnit test
:name file same as class file
:fill in for package same package name
create unit test
ctrl+F6 to run test
